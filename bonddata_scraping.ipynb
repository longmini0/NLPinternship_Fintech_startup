We intend to allocate an amount equal to the net proceeds from the sale of the notes to the previous acquisition of the Galleria Office Towers in February 2020 for $396.2 million, which has received LEED Certified certification. We may also allocate or re-allocate net proceeds from this offering to other Eligible Green Projects.  We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to repay borrowings outstanding under our $300 million unsecured 2020 term loan, with any remaining amounts being used to repay borrowings outstanding on our revolving credit facility or under one of our other term loans or for other business purposes. We borrowed the full amount under our $300 million unsecured 2020 term loan in March 2020 to repay, in part, indebtedness we incurred in order to complete the acquisition of the Galleria Office Towers. Our $300 million unsecured 2020 term loan has a maturity date of March 12, 2021, subject to extension at our option, and currently bears interest at LIBOR plus 140 basis points. As of the date hereof, all $300 million of the $300 million unsecured 2020 term loan was outstanding.

We expect to allocate all of the net proceeds from this offering to previously incurred acquisition costs relating to that building.  Eligible Green Projects include projects that meet the Eligibility Criteria above with the expenditures and/or certification occurring during the three years prior to the issue date of the notes or during the term of the notes.  Process for Project Evaluation and Selection  Our real estate operations team will select Eligible Green Projects for the review and approval of our corporate finance team. The corporate finance team will be responsible for tracking the allocation to Eligible Green Projects.    S-13  Table of Contents Management of Proceeds  We intend to allocate an amount equal to the net proceeds from the sale of the notes to previously incurred acquisition costs relating to Galleria Office Towers. We may also allocate or re-allocate net proceeds from this offering to other Eligible Green Projects.  As long as the notes are outstanding, our internal records will show the allocation of the amount equal to the net proceeds of this offering to Eligible Green Projects.  Payment of principal and interest on the notes will be made from our general funds and will not be directly linked to the performance of any Eligible Green Projects.  Any portion of the amount equal to the net proceeds from this offering allocated to Eligible Green Projects that have been sold, prepaid or otherwise become ineligible shall be reallocated to other Eligible Green Projects.  Reporting  During the term of the notes, until such time as an amount equal to the net proceeds from the notes has been fully allocated to Eligible Green Projects, we will publish annual updates in a Green Bond Allocation Report on our website detailing, at a minimum, the allocation of an amount equal to the net proceeds from this offering to Eligible Green Projects, together with the achieved or expected level of LEED or BREEAM certification and relevant expected impact metrics, where feasible.  External Review  Assurance  Our updates will be accompanied by (i) an assertion by management that an amount equal to the net proceeds from this offering were invested in Eligible Green Projects, and (ii) a report from an independent accountant in respect of the independent accountantÂ’s examination of managementÂ’s assertion conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.  LEED Certification  Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (Â“LEEDÂ”) is a voluntary, third party building certification process developed by the U.S. Green Building Council (Â“USGBCÂ”), a non-profit organization. The USGBC developed the LEED certification process to (i) evaluate the environmental performance from a whole-building perspective over a buildingÂ’s life cycle, (ii) provide a definitive standard for what constitutes a Â“green building,Â” (iii) enhance environmental awareness among architects and building contractors, and (iv) encourage the design and construction of energy-efficient, water-conserving buildings that use sustainable or green resources and\n"

We intend to allocate an amount equal to the net proceeds from the sale of the notes to finance or refinance, in whole or in part, one or more new or existing Eligible Green Projects. See Â“Risk FactorsÂ—Risks Relating to the NotesÂ” in this prospectus supplement.  Â“Eligible Green ProjectsÂ” are investments and expenditures to be made by us after the issuance date of the notes or made by us in the 24 months prior to such date, in eligible Green Projects as defined in and aligned with the four core components of the Green Bond Principles, which recommend transparency and disclosure and promote integrity with respect to Â“sustainableÂ” bonds. We expect that each of our Eligible Green Projects meets or will meet one or more of the eligibility criteria described below.  We have identified Eligible Green Projects in three main categories. These projects are in service of our carbon footprint reduction strategy and the strategic areas where we believe we can make the most positive environmental impact:    Â•  Climate change risks mitigation and adaptation for our operations  Â•  Efficient use of water resources and hydrological safety in the territories where we have presence Â•  Waste management and recycling of PET plastic bottles  The following are examples of Eligible Green Projects:    Â•  Climate Change Adaptation: Expenditures related to procurement and usage of climate change module software that will allow us to accurately measure our carbon footprint in a systematized manner and track progress against our science-based targets.    Â•  Clean and Mass Transportation: Expenditures related to our own- and third-party transportation fleet such as:    Â•  Fully electric trucks and utility vehicles  Â•  Electric vehicle infrastructure including charging stations  Â•  Energy Efficiency: Expenditures related to energy-efficiency projects including equipment, systems, operational improvements and maintenance. Examples include:    Â•  Expenditures to improve and maintain energy efficiency including as it relates to heating, ventilation and air conditioning upgrades, LED lighting upgrades, variable-speed drives and motion detector conveyor systems that may result in a potential increase in energy efficiency of up to 45% and greenhouse gas (Â“GHGÂ”) emissions reduction of approximately 14% compared to the systems they are replacing.    Â•  Refrigeration system optimization: upgrading refrigeration equipment to improve energy efficiency and electricity consumption of cooling and vending equipment    Â•  Renewable Energy: Expenditures related to the construction, development, acquisition, maintenance, and operation of renewable energy, including solar, wind, geothermal with direct emissions of less than 100 g CO2/kWh and hydropower generation (Â£25 MW). Examples include:  Â•  On-site (manufacturing and distribution centers) renewable energy projects such as solar rooftop panels Â•  Sourcing expenditures pursuant to long-term (Â³ 5 years), project-tied power purchase agreements that were entered into prior to the issuance of the notes    Â•  Environmentally Sustainable Management of Living Natural Resources and Land Use: Expenditures related to preservation and reforestation initiatives in the countries where we have presence.
